1. Enhanced security by forcing HTTPS-only access:
   - Modified docker-compose.prod.yml to comment out direct port exposure for extract service
   - Configured NGINX WAF to handle all traffic and enforce HTTPS
   - Added HTTP to HTTPS redirection in nginx-waf.conf
   - Added REDIRECT_TARGET environment variable to ensure proper redirection

2. Fixed WAF configuration to properly communicate with backend services:
   - Updated proxy_backend.conf to use HTTP for internal communication
   - Used setup_waf.sh script to apply configuration changes

3. Validated security enhancements:
   - Confirmed services are only accessible through WAF (port 443)
   - Tested HTTPS endpoint functionality (/health endpoint)
   - Created verify-https.sh script to test security configuration

4. Verification results:
   - ✅ HTTPS access is working properly
   - ✅ Direct access to extract service is blocked (port 8000 no longer exposed)
   - ⚠️ HTTP access works but doesn't redirect to HTTPS yet (needs fixing)

5. Known issues/To-do:
   - Fix HTTP to HTTPS redirection in WAF configuration
   - Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
   - Review WAF rules for possible customization
